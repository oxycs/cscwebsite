		Workspace is a place where students come together to work on CS projects and coursework. It is a
		great opportunity to make connections with other CS students and get help from them.
		Additionally, tutors who work for Oxy's Scientific Scholars Achievement Program (SSAP), a
		student-led academic support organization, as well as class TAs are available for further help.
